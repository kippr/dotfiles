# ag returns results within a file in order, but order between files is not deterministic (b/c it is multithreaded).
# That ia a drag when you want to re-run complicated searches and pickup where you left off, so the below adds
# determinism
#
# sort is used for deterministic ordering of file-level results in VIM quicklist, but doesn't re-order within files:
# we only sort on file name (field 1, separated by colons) and use stable sort so that there is no rearranging
# if we just run sort on it's own on whole lines, you'll get line 99 after 901

ag --nogroup --nocolor --column $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 | LC_ALL=C sort -t : -k 1,1 -s
